# Reactables Watcher
Reactables Watcher is an extension for **Google Chrome** that lets you inspect every property from all [Glowie Reactables](https://github.com/glowieframework/reactables) components used in a webpage.

The inspector panel updates property values whenever your component is refreshed.

### Features
- Inspect component properties/models in real-time
- Highlight component elements in the DOM
- Quickly see components ids and names
- Tree view of component data

### How to use
Open a webpage that uses Reactables, then click the extension icon in the browser menu. You can toggle the panel visibility by clicking the extension icon again. If you hover a component name, its element will be highlighted in the page (if visible). If you hover a component element in the DOM, its title will also be highlighted in the inspector panel.
